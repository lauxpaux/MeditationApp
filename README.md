# MeditationApp
A simple mediation app built with Javascript. Following DevEd tutorial.

In this project I learned how to: 
a. Get total length using built in Javascript .getTotalLength().
b. Set a visual outline of time elapsed using outline, strokeDasharray, strokeDashoffset.
c. Set duration timer.
